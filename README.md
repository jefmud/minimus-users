## Minimus Users

A simple "users" model for the minimus framework

###exposes:

 **authenticate**(username, password) 
 
 - looks for an existing username
   and checks if the password matches the hashed version in the database
   if it does, it returns **True**, not, it returns **False**

**initialize**(datadir)

- initializes the JSON database in a directory

**get_user**(username, uid)

- returns a user record from a username
 or id.  On failure returns None
 
**get_users**()

- returns a list of all users

**delete_user**(username, uid)

- returns a user if it deleted a user
     identified by username or uid
     
**create_user**(username, password, `**kwargs`) 

- creates a user record
username, password required -- the only validation is that username does not
currently exist.  `**kwargs` are optional keyword arguments to include in the
user record... for example is_active=True, display_name=John Doe

**update_user**(username, `**kwargs`)

- add additional keyword arguments
      to an existing record.  If a keyword argument value is EXPLICITLY set to None
       the existing key/value will be removed.
       

**render_login**()

render_login(login_filename=None) returns a login page as a string contained
    login_file if None, then if loads module level file login.html
    login_filename : string of filename of login page HTML document or None.
    
    If None, then the package level standard login.html is loaded.
    returns a string HTML of login page
    NOTE: this is an experimental feature

**user_services()**

- command line interface for user services such as:  --createuser, --deleteuser, --listuser, --updateuser

The programmer can easily extend this with an update_user
